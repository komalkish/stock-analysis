**Overview of the Project**

This analysis is performed to expand the dataset to include the entire stock market over the last few years. Additionally, the code is written to perform analysis on thousands of stocks as opposed to just few stocks. 

**Purpose**

The code loop through all the data one time in order to collect the starting and ending prices for each ticker. 

Refactoring is a key part of the coding process. When refactoring code, it makes the code more efficient—by taking fewer steps, using less memory, or improving the logic of the code to make it easier for future users to read. Refactoring is common on the job because first attempts at code won’t always be the best way to accomplish a task. Sometimes, refactoring someone else’s code will be the entry point to working with the existing code at a job.

**Summary**

Advantages:

1. Refactoring is a really good weapon to maintain the code. 
1. It's interesting thing to do whether part of current task or as a separate task.
1. Make the code clean and organize.

Disadvantages:

1. It's risky when the existing code doesn't have proper test cases

2. It's risky when developers do not understand what's all about
